planner: |
  You are a planning assistant that can decompose a problem into smaller tasks using tools. 
  Output a YAML that includes:
  - the problem,
  - a list of subtasks,
  - each subtask's tool,
  - a unique ID,
  - and which previous subtasks provide inputs to this one.

  Each subtask may list one or more `inputs` referencing previous task IDs.

  Example:
  ```
  problem: "..."
  subtasks:
    - id: "search"
      task: "..."
      tool: "Tool A"
      inputs: []
    - id: "summarize"
      task: "..."
      tool: "Tool B"
      inputs: ["search"]
  ```

  The problem is:
  {{problem}}

  Use ONLY tools from the following list:
  {{tools_details}}

  Output:

tool-query: |
  {{{input}}}

tool-timeline: |
  Create a JSON object that can be used to plot a timeline of the following information:
  {{{input}}}
  The result should confirm to the vega-lite spec, using either a Gantt chart or a dot plot.
  Each event, date, or date range should be shown as a separate entry on the y-axis, sorted by date.
  Provide the JSON result only, no explanation.

tool-validate: |
  You are a validation assistant verifying the result of a process that answer's a user request.
  You will be given the request and the computed result, and need to respond back with
  (i) true/false indicating whether the request has been answered, (ii) rationale explaining why.
  
  Example Output:
  ```
  rationale: (explain briefly why the request was or was not answered)
  isRequestAnswered: (true or false)
  ```
  
  User Request:
  {{{user_request}}}
  
  Computed Result:
  {{{proposed_result}}}

# Agent Flow Logging Implementation Summary

This implementation fulfills issue #520 by adapting the AgenticView to show intermediate results emitted from agent flows as they are received, similar to the command-line logger but displayed in the UI.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. UI-Based Agent Flow Collector
- **AgentFlowUICollector** - New inner class in AgenticView that implements FlowCollector<AgentChatEvent>
- Captures all agent events (user messages, progress, reasoning, tool usage, responses, errors)
- Formats events for display in the UI with consistent labeling and indentation
- Updates the UI log in real-time as events are received

### 2. Enhanced Output Area
- Modified AgenticView output to use a tabbed interface with two tabs:
  - **"Agent Log"** - Shows intermediate results and progress as they happen
  - **"Final Result"** - Shows the final result (existing functionality)
- Agent Log tab contains a text area that displays formatted agent events
- Real-time updates as agent workflow progresses

### 3. Event Processing
- Replaces console-only logging (`awaitResponseWithLogging()`) with UI logging
- Processes all AgentChatEvent types:
  - User messages
  - Progress updates
  - Reasoning/thought process
  - Task planning
  - Tool invocations and results
  - Streaming tokens
  - Final responses
  - Errors

### 4. Event Formatting
- Consistent format: `[EVENT_TYPE] message content`
- Multi-line content is properly indented
- Streaming tokens are concatenated in real-time
- Error messages are clearly marked

## How It Works

1. When an agent workflow starts, the AgentFlowUICollector is created
2. The agent flow events are processed through the UI collector instead of console logger
3. Each event is formatted and appended to the agent log text area
4. Users can see real-time progress in the "Agent Log" tab
5. Final result is still displayed in the "Final Result" tab

## Example Output

The agent log shows events like this:

```
[USER] Help me write a professional email
[PROGRESS] Starting agent workflow...
[REASONING] I need to gather information about the email requirements
[TASK] task-1: Identify email purpose and audience
[TOOL-IN] text_analyzer: Analyze this request:
         - Purpose: Professional email
         - Audience: Unknown
         - Content: Not specified
[TOOL-OUT] text_analyzer: Email requires: recipient info, subject, purpose
[PROGRESS] Generating email template...
[TOOL-IN] email_generator: Create professional email template
[TOOL-OUT] email_generator: Subject: [Your Subject Here]
         
         Dear [Recipient Name],
         
         I hope this email finds you well.
         
         [Your message content here]
         
         Best regards,
         [Your name]
[FINAL] I've created a professional email template for you...
[REASONING] Provided a complete email template with placeholders for customization
```

## Benefits

1. **Real-time Visibility** - Users can see what the agent is doing as it happens
2. **Better Debugging** - Intermediate steps are visible for troubleshooting
3. **Enhanced User Experience** - No need to check console logs
4. **Consistent Interface** - Follows existing PromptFx UI patterns
5. **Non-disruptive** - Final result display is unchanged

## Testing

- Created AgentLogDemoTest that demonstrates the functionality
- Shows how different event types are formatted and displayed
- Validates that the UI collector correctly processes all event types
- Compilation and build tests pass successfully

The implementation provides the same visibility as the command-line logger but integrates seamlessly into the PromptFx GUI, making agent workflows more transparent and user-friendly.

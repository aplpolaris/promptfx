      Generate a list from the input text based on the provided list, as a JSON with four parts:
        1. "item_category": copy the category provided
        2. "known_items": copy the list of items provided
        3. "items_in_input": list of items found in or related to the input text -- they must be an item in the given category, and should be underlying/higher-level concepts as appropriate
        4. "new_items": anything in the list of found items that is not in "known_items", along with a reason for their inclusion (leave empty if there are no new items)
      New items should be substantially different than existing ones (not just alternate word form). They should follow the style conventions of "known_items" (e.g. spacing, punctuation, case, etc.).

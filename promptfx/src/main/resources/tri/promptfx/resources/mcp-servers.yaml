# MCP Server Registry Configuration
# This file defines available MCP servers that can be used by PromptFx
#
# Supports two formats:
#
# 1. PromptFx format (with explicit "type" field):
#    servers:
#      my-server:
#        type: stdio
#        command: "npx"
#        args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/tmp"]
#
# 2. Claude Desktop/OpenAI format (type inferred from fields):
#    mcpServers:
#      my-server:
#        command: "npx"
#        args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/tmp"]
#
# Both formats are supported for backward compatibility.

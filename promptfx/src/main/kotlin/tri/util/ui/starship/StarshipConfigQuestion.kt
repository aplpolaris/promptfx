/**
 * Supports configuration of a random question generator.
 * Templates use [TOPIC_KEY] and [EXAMPLE_KEY] fields, which may be paired together to provide a specific example question about that topic.
 * Any other key in [lists] may be used in the template as a field to be filled with random values from the corresponding list, with e.g. {{tools:3}} denoting a random set of three tools.
 * This allows for "pick from A or B", "pick from A, B, or C", etc. prompt elements.

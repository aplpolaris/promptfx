# PromptLibrary Filter Example
# This file filters which prompts are loaded from the built-in prompt library.
# Pattern matching supports simple wildcards using '*'.
#
# If includeIds or includeCategories are specified, only prompts matching these patterns will be loaded.
# Then, any prompts matching excludeIds or excludeCategories patterns will be filtered out.
# If no includes are specified, all prompts are loaded by default, then excludes are applied.

# Include specific prompt IDs by pattern (optional)
includeIds: []
  # Examples:
  # - "text-*"           # Include all text-related prompts
  # - "docs-qa/*"        # Include all document Q&A prompts
  # - "generate-*"       # Include all generation prompts

# Include specific categories by pattern (optional)  
includeCategories: []
  # Examples:
  # - "text"             # Include all prompts in the text category
  # - "docs"             # Include all prompts in the docs category
  # - "generate"         # Include all generation-related prompts

# Exclude specific prompt IDs by pattern (optional)
excludeIds: []
  # Examples:
  # - "*beta*"           # Exclude any prompts with 'beta' in the ID
  # - "experimental/*"   # Exclude all experimental prompts
  # - "*-test@*"         # Exclude all test versions

# Exclude specific categories by pattern (optional)
excludeCategories: []
  # Examples:
  # - "experimental"     # Exclude all experimental prompts
  # - "internal"         # Exclude internal-use prompts
  # - "deprecated"       # Exclude deprecated prompts
